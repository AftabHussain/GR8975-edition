title: Introduction to the Minimal Edition
---

The digital minimal edition is a course project of the graduate-level digital humanities seminar, **“HIST GR8975: What is a Book in the 21st Century? Working With Historical Texts in a Digital Environment”** offered by the Department of History at Columbia University as the 2017 History in Action Clinic Course. Students, instructors, TAs from History and Computer Science, and Project Assistants worked collaboratively and creatively to construct this edition, spending the first half of the semester learning the skills--both collaborative and technical--necessary to such a project, and the second half preparing the text by generating a marked up version for Ed, the Minimal Edition platform created by Alex Gil and Terry Catapano. 

The basic data set for the minimal edition is the working English translation of BnF Ms. Fr. 640, produced by successive Summer Text Workshops <url="http://www.makingandknowing.org/?page_id=14"> held by the Making and Knowing Project beginning in 2014. This transcription  is the . This edition has basic and limited feature, yet serves as important prototype for the design of the Project’s final digital critical edition. The project is an integral part of the **Making and Knowing Project**, and is in close collaboration with its other researches. The organization of the content in this edition corresponds to that in Ms. Fr. 640. The organizing element of the manuscript is called ‘entry’. These entries are individual or related instructions or observations on the experimentation with different crafts and natural materials. Students have marked up the structure of the entry, including identifier, title, main body of the text, marginalia and illustration. They have also used markup to identify specific elements in the entry, such as materials, tools, activities, names, etc. The presentation of the texts is in accordance with that in the original manuscript. The edition is electronically searchable and intuitive user-directed.

This digital edition is hosted on **Jekyll**, a minimal computing platform. It is designed to provide easy and enhanced reading experiences, and to encourage interaction with the content of the manuscript itself. It is open-access to encourage wider scope of innovative reading and research.
