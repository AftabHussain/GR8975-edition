Sohini Chattopadhyay
Sohini Chattopadhyay is a PhD student in the History of the Modern South Asia with interests in History of Science and public health, history of colonialism, urban history, and genealogies of the dead body. Her research interests are in reorganizations of burial and cremation patterns through different techniques and machines, and in making new uses of dead bodies in the 19th and 20th centuries, in Bombay, Calcutta and New Delhi. She specially focuses on urban municipalities and their interfaces with new groups that grew to assist in burials and cremations and to pose questions on rituals and 'colonial science'. She also has a keen interest in exploring digital tools that help in research analysis and representation. Prior to this, she received an M.A. in Modern Indian History from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi.
Benjamin Hiebert
Benjamin is a first year PhD student in the history department at Columbia University. He is broadly interested in the intellectual and cultural history of early modern Europe, and more specifically in the history of the human sciences during the eighteenth century.

Xiaomeng Liu
Xiaomeng Liu is a PhD student in history at the University of Hong Kong. His research focuses on the transformation of pharmaceutical technology in late imperial and modern China. His project tries to understand how a traditional craft of drug making was transformed by the involvement of modern machines, and how the process changed the manufacturing, marketing and consuming of what we called today the “Chinese drugs”. During his visit at the Center for Science and Society, he is participating in the Making & Knowing Project.
