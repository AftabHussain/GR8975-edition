## White bronzing

 
Apply some <span class="material">black</span>black with <span class="material">glue</span> on the medal, as described above, and then varnish it. Once dry, rub it with <span class="material">English point</span> using a <span class="tool">brush</span> or your <span class="tool">finger</span>. The said rubbed point embellishes <span class="material">lead</span> medals.
