## Black color for dyeing

 
Take <span class="material">lye</span> made from <span class="material">quicklime</span> and <span class="material">white lead</span>, mix and leave to soak and you will have a dark brown dye, and reiterating the same you will make black. Try other colours with the lye made of <span class="material">lime</span>.
