## Ground gold and ground silver

 
 You have to calcine your pure gold with ☿ and then let your amalgam dry well and the said mercury fly off. Then crush it on marble with gummed water. As for silver you have to use it in its raw form and corrode it with aqua fortis, then take it out with a copper blade and rinse it well and then grind it with gum water.
