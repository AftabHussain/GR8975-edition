## To varnish

 
   Turpentine varnish does not need any glue since it is fat and viscous and does not penetrate the wood as spike lavender varnish and sandarac varnish would. Spike lavender varnish does not require any glue on iron and similar materials which cannot be permeated, but on wood and on colors which do not contain gum or colle de détrempe, it is necessary to lay one coat of the said glue colle de retailles and allow to dry, then varnish.
