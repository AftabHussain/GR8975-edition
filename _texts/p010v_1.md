## For painting in oil on taffeta without the oil running

 
  One needs to make a layer of batture, which is made of colle forte soaked for 24 hours in water then gently boiled so it is not too strong. Then stir in a little honey to soften it, and bring it all to a boil. And on top of this layer, which will soon be dry, you will be able to paint in oil, which will soften the layer even more, and which will also serve to make an underlayer for gold. Alum water also keeps oil from running.
