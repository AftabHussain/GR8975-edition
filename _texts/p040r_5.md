## Grottos

 
To fill some empty place that cannot be laden with hanging rocks, one puts a piece of thick <span class="material">parchment</span> close to the fire, which shrinks & crumples. Then one paints it with <span class="material">distemper</span>, then in <span class="material">oil</span>. Next one affixes it.
