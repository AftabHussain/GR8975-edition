## To give the color of all kind of metals and woods and other things

 
    Take touchstone and pumice stone as much of one as of the other and grind them together, mix that with a colle de retailles stronger than that used for painting, and apply a layer of it on whatever you like. Once dry, rub this layer on any metal whatsoever, then burnish it.
