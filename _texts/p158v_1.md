## Colors for green leafs

 
One usually paints them with oil colors, because distemper colors do not stay on. For marigold flowers, lightly ground minium for some of them; for more yellowish ones, mix in a bit of massicot. For green, the vert—de—gris is dark and too somber. If it is a yellowish—green, you can mix with the vert—de—gris a bit of yellow ochre and scudegrum. If the green is dark, mix in some coals made from peach pits, which makes a greenish—black, in the same way than the bone of an ox foot bone makes a bluish—black. And in such a manner, by judgement and discretion, put the color on the natural flower or leaf to see whether it is similar to the original. But paint it on very lightly so as not to cover the features of the work.
