## "What Is a Book in the 21st Century? Working with Historical Texts in a Digital Environment"

This course introduced graduate students at Columbia University to techniques of working in digital environments. Through hands-on assignments (with plenty of assistance), students have learned a variety of skills that constitute literacy in digital humanities, and are now able to take their newfound digital literacy with them to pursue their own study, research, and future work.

Throughout the course, skills were built by implementing them to collectively create a small scale digital edition, which is the site you are now viewing. This digital edition draws on collaboration with, and research done by, the Making and Knowing Project (http://www.makingandknowing.org/) on an anonymous sixteenth-century French compilation of artistic and technical recipes (BnF Ms. Fr. 640). The Project’s existing English translation constitutes the “data” with which students have worked to create this minimal digital edition.
