## "What Is a Book in the 21st Century? Working with Historical Texts in a Digital Environment"

This History course (HIST GR8975) introduced graduate students at Columbia University to techniques of working with texts in digital environments. The course was supported by the **<a href="http://historyinaction.columbia.edu/">History in Action</a>** initiative of the History department, The **<a href="http://www.makingandknowing.org/">Making and Knowing Project</a>**, the **<a href="http://online.columbia.edu/rfp--hybrid-courses.html">Provost's Hybrid Grant</a>** in collaboration with **<a href="http://ctl.columbia.edu/">The Center for Teaching and Learning</a>**, and the **<a href="http://collaboratory.columbia.edu/">Collaboratory Program</a>**. Through hands-on assignments (with plenty of assistance), students have learned a variety of skills that constitute literacy in digital humanities, and are now able to take their newfound digital literacy with them to pursue their own study, research, and future work.

Throughout the course, skills were built by implementing them to collectively create a minimal digital edition, which is the site you are now viewing. This digital edition draws on collaboration with, and research done by the Making and Knowing Project on an anonymous sixteenth-century French compilation of artistic and technical recipes (BnF Ms. Fr. 640). The Project’s existing English translation (still a work in progress) constitutes the “data” with which students worked to create this minimal digital edition.
